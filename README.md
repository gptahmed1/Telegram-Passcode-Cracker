## üìã Overview

A high-performance security testing tool designed to evaluate the resilience of Telegram passcodes against brute-force attacks. Employs advanced proxy management and multi-threading to maximize attempt efficiency.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Maximum Performance**: Optimized multi-threaded architecture with dynamic resource allocation
- **Advanced Proxy Management**: 
  - Multi-protocol support (SOCKS5, SOCKS4, HTTP)
  - Automatic validation and performance ranking
  - Intelligent rotation and failure recovery
- **Real-time Interface**: Comprehensive statistics and progress monitoring
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Self-tunes based on system capabilities and network conditions
- **Intelligent Code Prioritization**: Tests common patterns first (sequential, repeated digits)
- **Comprehensive Logging System**: Detailed logs for in-depth analysis

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages: requests, termcolor, rich
- Internet connection
- Proxy list (recommended)

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI4Arabs/telegram-passcode-cracker.git
cd telegram-passcode-cracker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Usage

1. Prepare `proxy.txt` with proxies (format: `IP:PORT` or `IP:PORT:LOCATION`)
2. Prepare `numbers.txt` with passcodes to try
3. Run: `python main.py`
4. Enter target phone number when prompted (+COUNTRYCODE format)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create `config.json` to customize:

```json
{
    "MAX_THREADS": 500,
    "REQUEST_TIMEOUT": 6,
    "PROXY_PROTOCOLS": ["socks5", "socks4", "http"],
    "PROXY_FALLBACK_MODE": true,
    "PROXY_CHECK_TIMEOUT": 5
}
```

## üìÑ File Structure

- `main.py`: Main executable
- `proxy.txt`: Proxy list
- `numbers.txt`: Passcodes to test
- `config.json`: Custom configuration
- `logs/`: Detailed logs directory
- `cracked.txt`: Successful results

## üîç Troubleshooting

- **No valid proxies**: Check proxy.txt format is correct
- **Slow performance**: Increase MAX_THREADS or use faster proxies
- **Connection errors**: Check internet connectivity and proxy status
